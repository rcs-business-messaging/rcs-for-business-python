# Python samples using the Business Communications API

RCS for Business uses the [Business Communications API](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/reference/business-communications/rest) for two
separate sets of operations:

-   For developers: to create RCS for Business agents, manage assets and
    submit agents for approval. These are known as [RBM Management API](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/guides/management-api/overview) functions.
-   For carriers: to approve, reject and suspend RCS for Business agents
    submitted to their network. These are know as [RBM Operations API](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging/carriers/operations-api/get-started) features.

Google does not provide a python stub library for these APIs as calling the REST api is very simple from python.
